Phaser 2 had buttons but they aren't built in to Phaser 3. In reality, they are simple to make on our own. In this tutorial we'll break down what it means for something to be a button and how to make one in Phaser-land.

## Buttons Aren't Scary

Buttons aren't some magic black box of mystery. A button in its simplest form is something that responds to clicks.

That's it.

Hover states, animations, fancy effects, whatever, are just icing on the cake. Phaser makes it really easy to make something clickable, so let's start with building that.

## Project Setup

I'll be using the project setup from [this blog post](https://snowbillr.github.io/blog/2018-04-09-a-modern-web-development-setup-for-phaser-3/). You can follow through that post to set up the project yourself, or you can clone the full setup [from GitHub](https://github.com/snowbillr/phaser3-webpack-es6-dev-starter) and follow the instructions in its README.

Once you have the project running you should see something like this in your browser:

![browser initial setup](/img/posts/buttons-in-phaser-3/browser-initial-setup.png)

## The Most Basic Button

Lucky for us our project already has taken care of the first part of our most basic button. That ugly green text on that ugly black background? Looks like a perfect candidate for an ugly button!.

Every object that gets added to our scene is an instance that extends from `Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject`. In this case, `Phaser.GameObjects.Text` extends the base `GameObject` class. It's this class that provides us with the method we need to make our text (or image, or sprite, or any other `GameObject`) clickable.

We need tell Phaser that we want our player to be able to interact with our `GameObject`. [I wonder what method we should call on GameObject.](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/v3.10.1/src/gameobjects/GameObject.js#L352)

Great guess! It *is* the `setInteractive` method. Don't worry about any of the arguments to the method for now. If we call that method on our text object with no parameters, it will make the rectangular bounds of our text interactive, which is exactly what we want.

So let's do that in `scenes/simple-scene.js`. We'll also keep a reference to our text object in a variable so we have access to it later. Since we don't need the coke can sprite, we can remove that as well.

```javascript
export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    const helloButton = this.add.text(100, 100, 'Hello Phaser!', { fill: '#0f0' });
    helloButton.setInteractive();
  }
}
```

Great! But it doesn't seem like anything has changed in our browser. We can check that our text is interactive by adding event listeners to it. When we tell Phaser a `GameObject` is interactive it will start to emit events whenever any player interaction occurs with that `GameObject`. These events are emitted in two ways:

1. Directly from the `GameObject` itself
1. From the `InputPlugin` object (`this.input` in a scene)

Since we only care about interaction events on our `GameObject` and not for the scene in general, we'll only listen to events coming directly from our text and ignore those coming from the `InputPlugin`.

All `GameObject`s extend from [EventEmitter3](https://github.com/primus/eventemitter3), so we can listen for the input events directly on the `GameObject` with the [`on`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_on_eventname_listener) method. Let's verify our text is actually emitting the input events by listening for the `pointerover` event, which is fired when the cursor first overlaps with the game object.

```javascript
export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    const helloButton = this.add.text(100, 100, 'Hello Phaser!', { fill: '#0f0' });
    helloButton.setInteractive();

    helloButton.on('pointerover', () => { console.log('pointerover'); });
  }
}
```

![browser pointerover event](/img/posts/buttons-in-phaser-3/browser-pointerover-event.gif)

Great, we know our "button" is firing off input events that we can listen for and respond to. The other events that we care about are:

- `pointerout` - this is the opposite of `pointerover`. It fires when the cursor *leaves* the area of the game object.
- `pointerdown` - this fires at the start of a click or a touch on the game object, literally when the mouse button is pushed down or when a finger touches down.
- `pointerup` - this is the opposite of `pointerdown`. It fires when the mouse button is released or a finger is lifted up from the game object.

The Most Basic Button™ only cares about when the user clicks on it, so to start we'll only need to listen to the `pointerdown` event. Let's set up our scene to have have a click counter that increases everytime we click on our button. We'll change our `helloButton` to a `clickButton` and add another text object to display the click counter's value.

We'll also chain our method calls to the `clickButton` object to make it slightly easier to read.

```javascript
export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    let clickCount = 0;
    this.clickCountText = this.add.text(100, 200, '');

    const clickButton = this.add.text(100, 100, 'Click me!', { fill: '#0f0' })
      .setInteractive()
      .on('pointerdown', () => this.updateClickCountText(++clickCount) );

    this.updateClickCountText(clickCount);
  }

  updateClickCountText(clickCount) {
    this.clickCountText.setText(`Button has been clicked ${clickCount} times.`);
  }
}
```

![browser most basic button](/img/posts/buttons-in-phaser-3/browser-most-basic-button.gif)

So there's our Most Basic Button™.

## The Slightly More Complicated Button

Didn't it feel weird when you moused over The Most Basic Button™ and nothing changed visually? This is because you were expecting the button to have some kind of hover state. We can detect when a user is hovering over a button with the `pointerover` event, and detect when the user leaves the hover state with the `pointerout` event. Let's have our button change its text color when the user hovers over it. We can add listeners for those two events to change our button's color. We'll also need to save a reference to our button in the scene so we can call the `setStyle` method on it from a couple helper methods we'll write.

```javascript
export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    let clickCount = 0;
    this.clickCountText = this.add.text(100, 200, '');

    this.clickButton = this.add.text(100, 100, 'Click me!', { fill: '#0f0' })
     .setInteractive()
     .on('pointerdown', () => this.updateClickCountText(++clickCount) )
     .on('pointerover', () => this.enterButtonHoverState() )
     .on('pointerout', () => this.enterButtonRestState() );

    this.updateClickCountText(clickCount);
  }

  updateClickCountText(clickCount) {
    this.clickCountText.setText(`Button has been clicked ${clickCount} times.`);
  }

  enterButtonHoverState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#ff0'});
  }

  enterButtonRestState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0f0' });
  }
}
```

![browser simple hover](/img/posts/buttons-in-phaser-3/browser-simple-hover.gif)

Similarly, our Slightly More Complicated Button™ should have an active state too. Which gives our button three different states in total: rest, hover, and active. Let's explicitly call out how we will transition between all our states:

```
          pointerover             pointerdown
+------+  ---------->  +-------+  ---------->  +--------+
| rest |               | hover |               | active |
+------+  <----------  +-------+  <----------  +--------+
          pointerout              pointerup
```

We can tell when our button becomes active by listening to the `pointerdown` event. We'll also change our existing listener that updates the counter to run on the `pointerup` event so we can make our button feel like it's correctly transitioning through its states.

```javascript
export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    let clickCount = 0;
    this.clickCountText = this.add.text(100, 200, '');

    this.clickButton = this.add.text(100, 100, 'Click me!', { fill: '#0f0' })
      .setInteractive()
      .on('pointerover', () => this.enterButtonHoverState() )
      .on('pointerout', () => this.enterButtonRestState() )
      .on('pointerdown', () => this.enterButtonActiveState() )
      .on('pointerup', () => {
        this.updateClickCountText(++clickCount);
        this.enterButtonHoverState();
    });

    this.updateClickCountText(clickCount);
  }

  updateClickCountText(clickCount) {
    this.clickCountText.setText(`Button has been clicked ${clickCount} times.`);
  }

  enterButtonHoverState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#ff0'});
  }

  enterButtonRestState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0f0' });
  }

  enterButtonActiveState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0ff' });
  }
}
```

![browser simple hover and active](/img/posts/buttons-in-phaser-3/browser-simple-hover-and-active.gif)

## The Just A Little More Intuitive Yet Slightly More Complicated Button

As of version 3.10.0, Phaser makes it very easy for us to change the mouse cursor to a hand during the hover state of our button. Instead of calling `setInteractive` on our `GameObject` with no parameters, we'll pass in an object with the `useHandCursor` property set to true.

```javascript
export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    let clickCount = 0;
    this.clickCountText = this.add.text(100, 200, '');

    this.clickButton = this.add.text(100, 100, 'Click me!', { fill: '#0f0' })
      .setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true })
      .on('pointerover', () => this.enterButtonHoverState() )
      .on('pointerout', () => this.enterButtonRestState() )
      .on('pointerdown', () => this.enterButtonActiveState() )
      .on('pointerup', () => {
        this.updateClickCountText(++clickCount);
        this.enterButtonHoverState();
    });

    this.updateClickCountText(clickCount);
  }

  updateClickCountText(clickCount) {
    this.clickCountText.setText(`Button has been clicked ${clickCount} times.`);
  }

  enterButtonHoverState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#ff0'});
  }

  enterButtonRestState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0f0' });
  }

  enterButtonActiveState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0ff' });
  }
}
```

## Keeping It Clean

In the spirit of keeping our codebase well organized, we have some refactoring to do. If we want to add more than one of our ugly buttons to our game, we would need to duplicate this code each time. Instead of that, let's extract the code for the button into its own class.

> Bonus Tip: Phaser has an excellent plugin system that allows you to add your own `GameObject` factories. But honestly, I haven't taken the time to dive into it yet, plus its a little outside the scope of this tutorial. As an exercise on your own, try and build this out into a real plugin!

### A Custom `GameObject`

Let's keep it simple and stick with a text-only button. Make a new folder in your project to keep our custom game object in:

```bash
mkdir src/game-objects
```

Then create a file for our text button:

```bash
touch src/game-objects/text-button.js
```

And then in the file, lets start off with exporting an empty class that extends the Phaser text object.

```javascript
export class TextButton extends Phaser.GameObjects.Text {

}
```

Congratulations! You've created your first custom GameObject. Granted, it doesn't have any custom functionality - it's just a renamed text object at this point. But we may as well start using it in our refactoring process.

We'll need to slightly adjust how we're creating our text button as well. Since there is no factory method for our custom game object, we'll have to instantiate it manually and then add it to the scene. Let's start by doing that with the regular Phaser text object.

```javascript
export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    let clickCount = 0;
    this.clickCountText = this.add.text(100, 200, '');

    this.clickButton = new Phaser.GameObjects.Text(this, 100, 100, 'Click me!', { fill: '#0f0'});
    this.add.existing(this.clickButton);
    this.clickButton
      .setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true })
      .on('pointerover', () => this.enterButtonHoverState() )
      .on('pointerout', () => this.enterButtonRestState() )
      .on('pointerdown', () => this.enterButtonActiveState() )
      .on('pointerup', () => {
        this.updateClickCountText(++clickCount);
        this.enterButtonHoverState();
    });

    this.updateClickCountText(clickCount);
  }

  updateClickCountText(clickCount) {
    this.clickCountText.setText(`Button has been clicked ${clickCount} times.`);
  }

  enterButtonHoverState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#ff0'});
  }

  enterButtonRestState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0f0'});
  }

  enterButtonActiveState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0ff' });
  }
}
```

We call the `Phaser.GameObjects.Text` constructor and pass in the Scene instance as the first parameter. Then we call the Scene's `this.add.existing` method and pass in our instantiated Text object. This is almost exactly what the `this.add.text` method does internally.

Now, we can import our `TextButton` and use that instead.

```javascript
import { TextButton } from '../game-objects/text-button';

export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    let clickCount = 0;
    this.clickCountText = this.add.text(100, 200, '');

    this.clickButton = new TextButton(this, 100, 100, 'Click me!', { fill: '#0f0'});
    this.add.existing(this.clickButton);
    this.clickButton
      .setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true })
      .on('pointerover', () => this.enterButtonHoverState() )
      .on('pointerout', () => this.enterButtonRestState() )
      .on('pointerdown', () => this.enterButtonActiveState() )
      .on('pointerup', () => {
        this.updateClickCountText(++clickCount);
        this.enterButtonHoverState();
    });

    this.updateClickCountText(clickCount);
  }

  updateClickCountText(clickCount) {
    this.clickCountText.setText(`Button has been clicked ${clickCount} times.`);
  }

  enterButtonHoverState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#ff0'});
  }

  enterButtonRestState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0f0'});
  }

  enterButtonActiveState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0ff' });
  }
}
```

Now that we are using an instance of our `TextButton`, let's start baking in some of its functionality. We'll hardcode it to start, then allow the button to be configured through some parameters in its constructor.

### Functionality for our `TextButton`

We can start by having the button automatically set itself as interactive. We want to do this when the button is instantiated, so we'll have to override the constructor for the button.

It's important that our overridden constructor calls the `Phaser.GameObjects.Text`'s constructor prior to our custom functionality. This way, the Text object gets created correctly in Phaser. So we take in the same parameters that we are currently passing to the Text object's constructor, and just forward them along in ours.

```javascript
export class TextButton extends Phaser.GameObjects.Text {
  constructor(scene, x, y, text, style) {
    super(scene, x, y, text, style);
  }
}
```

Now we can add remove the call to the `setInteractive` method from our Scene and add it in to our `TextButton` constructor.

```javascript
export class TextButton extends Phaser.GameObjects.Text {
  constructor(scene, x, y, text, style) {
    super(scene, x, y, text, style);

    this.setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true });
  }
}
```

```javascript
import { TextButton } from '../game-objects/text-button';

export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    let clickCount = 0;
    this.clickCountText = this.add.text(100, 200, '');

    this.clickButton = new TextButton(this, 100, 100, 'Click me!', { fill: '#0f0'});
    this.add.existing(this.clickButton);
    this.clickButton
      .on('pointerover', () => this.enterButtonHoverState() )
      .on('pointerout', () => this.enterButtonRestState() )
      .on('pointerdown', () => this.enterButtonActiveState() )
      .on('pointerup', () => {
        this.updateClickCountText(++clickCount);
        this.enterButtonHoverState();
    });

    this.updateClickCountText(clickCount);
  }

  updateClickCountText(clickCount) {
    this.clickCountText.setText(`Button has been clicked ${clickCount} times.`);
  }

  enterButtonHoverState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#ff0'});
  }

  enterButtonRestState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0f0'});
  }

  enterButtonActiveState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0ff' });
  }
}
```

And our `TextButton` still works! This is a good example of how refactoring generally goes. Build something out, then pull out the related parts into their own components.

Let's pull in our active state next. This means taking our `pointerdown` event listener out of our Scene and putting it into the `TextButton`. We'll also pull the `enterButtonActiveState` method into our `TextButton` class as well. Don't forget that in our `TextButton`, the `this` context is the game object itself. So we'll call `this.setStyle` in our `enterButtonActiveState` method instead of how the Scene was calling it before.

```javascript
export class TextButton extends Phaser.GameObjects.Text {
  constructor(scene, x, y, text, style) {
    super(scene, x, y, text, style);

    this.setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true })
      .on('pointerdown', () => this.enterButtonActiveState() )
  }

  enterButtonActiveState() {
    this.setStyle({ fill: '#0ff' });
  }
}
```

```javascript
import { TextButton } from '../game-objects/text-button';

export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    let clickCount = 0;
    this.clickCountText = this.add.text(100, 200, '');

    this.clickButton = new TextButton(this, 100, 100, 'Click me!', { fill: '#0f0'});
    this.add.existing(this.clickButton);
    this.clickButton
      .on('pointerover', () => this.enterButtonHoverState() )
      .on('pointerout', () => this.enterButtonRestState() )
      .on('pointerup', () => {
        this.updateClickCountText(++clickCount);
        this.enterButtonHoverState();
    });

    this.updateClickCountText(clickCount);
  }

  updateClickCountText(clickCount) {
    this.clickCountText.setText(`Button has been clicked ${clickCount} times.`);
  }

  enterButtonHoverState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#ff0'});
  }

  enterButtonRestState() {
    this.clickButton.setStyle({ fill: '#0f0'});
  }
}
```

Let's pull in the rest of the style changes for the button now. We'll leave the function call to update the `clickCountText` in our Scene for now.


```javascript
export class TextButton extends Phaser.GameObjects.Text {
  constructor(scene, x, y, text, style) {
    super(scene, x, y, text, style);

    this.setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true })
      .on('pointerover', () => this.enterButtonHoverState() )
      .on('pointerout', () => this.enterButtonRestState() )
      .on('pointerdown', () => this.enterButtonActiveState() )
      .on('pointerup', () => this.enterButtonHoverState() );
  }

  enterButtonHoverState() {
    this.setStyle({ fill: '#ff0'});
  }

  enterButtonRestState() {
    this.setStyle({ fill: '#0f0'});
  }

  enterButtonActiveState() {
    this.setStyle({ fill: '#0ff' });
  }
}
```

```javascript
import { TextButton } from '../game-objects/text-button';

export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    let clickCount = 0;
    this.clickCountText = this.add.text(100, 200, '');

    this.clickButton = new TextButton(this, 100, 100, 'Click me!', { fill: '#0f0'});
    this.add.existing(this.clickButton);
    this.clickButton.on('pointerup', () => {
        this.updateClickCountText(++clickCount);
    });

    this.updateClickCountText(clickCount);
  }

  updateClickCountText(clickCount) {
    this.clickCountText.setText(`Button has been clicked ${clickCount} times.`);
  }
}
```

Awesome! Our code in the Scene is looking much cleaner already - the code in the scene doesn't have anything to do with changing the styles in our `TextButton`. That's a responsibility the `TextButton` should have for itself.

### Passing in a Callback

As developers we don't want to have to know how the `TextButton` works internally to use it. We shouldn't have to know that it considers a `pointerup` event to be the appropriate time to respond to the user's click. Having this knowledge abstracted away from our Scene and into the `TextButton` makes it a more reusable and simpler component. To fix this, we can pass in a callback function as a parameter to the `TextButton` constructor.

This change also involves slightly reworking our `updateClickCountText` method so that it knows about the `clickCount` value.

```javascript
export class TextButton extends Phaser.GameObjects.Text {
  constructor(scene, x, y, text, style, callback) {
    super(scene, x, y, text, style);

    this.setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true })
      .on('pointerover', () => this.enterButtonHoverState() )
      .on('pointerout', () => this.enterButtonRestState() )
      .on('pointerdown', () => this.enterButtonActiveState() )
      .on('pointerup', () => {
        this.enterButtonHoverState();
        callback();
      });
  }

  enterButtonHoverState() {
    this.setStyle({ fill: '#ff0'});
  }

  enterButtonRestState() {
    this.setStyle({ fill: '#0f0'});
  }

  enterButtonActiveState() {
    this.setStyle({ fill: '#0ff' });
  }
}
```

```javascript
import { TextButton } from '../game-objects/text-button';

export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    this.clickCount = 0;
    this.clickCountText = this.add.text(100, 200, '');

    this.clickButton = new TextButton(this, 100, 100, 'Click me!', { fill: '#0f0'}, () => this.updateClickCountText());
    this.add.existing(this.clickButton);

    this.updateClickCountText();
  }

  updateClickCountText() {
    this.clickCountText.setText(`Button has been clicked ${this.clickCount} times.`);
    this.clickCount++;
  }
}
```

Great! Everything that makes our `TextButton` a `TextButton` now lives inside the `TextButton` class. It knows how to change transition between its interaction state, as well as when to call the callback function that's passed in through its constructor. What that callback does is not a concern to the `TextButton`, but rather to our Scene.

### Adding Another TextButton

So let's put all this abstraction to good use. Let's add another button to our scene that will subtract one from our click count. We'll rework some of the code in our Scene here as well:

```javascript
import { TextButton } from '../game-objects/text-button';

export class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create() {
    this.clickCount = 0;
    this.clickCountText = this.add.text(100, 200, '');

    this.incrementButton = new TextButton(this, 100, 100, 'Increment Count', { fill: '#0f0'}, () => this.incrementClickCount());
    this.add.existing(this.incrementButton);

    this.decrementButton = new TextButton(this, 100, 150, 'Decrement Count', { fill: '#0f0'}, () => this.decrementClickCount());
    this.add.existing(this.decrementButton);

    this.updateClickCountText();
  }

  incrementClickCount() {
    this.clickCount += 1;
    this.updateClickCountText();
  }

  decrementClickCount() {
    this.clickCount -= 1;
    this.updateClickCountText();
  }

  updateClickCountText() {
    this.clickCountText.setText(`Button has been clicked ${this.clickCount} times.`);
  }
}
```

![browser increment decrement](/img/posts/buttons-in-phaser-3/browser-increment-decrement.gif)

**We didn't have to touch our `TextButton` class at all!** Since our `TextButton` only concerns itself with being a button, and our Scene only concerns itself with the actual scene logic, we were able to reuse our custom game object really easily.

### Wrapping It Up

You can find the full source of this example [up on github](https://www.github.com/snowbillr/buttons-in-phaser3). Phaser also has a great set of examples for interacting with the input systems. Take a look at these three examples for the same pointer events we used for our button: [pointerup](https://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src/input/game%20object/on%20up%20event.js), [pointerdown](https://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src/input/game%20object/on%20down%20event.js), [pointerover and pointerout](https://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src/input/game%20object/over%20and%20out%20events.js).

Hopefully it was helpful to see that buttons really aren't anything special in Phaser: they are just `GameObjects` that respond to pointer events. That means that rather than a Text object, you could also make a button out of a Sprite, or an Image, or any other game object!

I hope that the exercise in refactoring was helpful too. This is a good pattern to follow for building out different components of your game. Build it and make it work in your scene, refactor it out so that its logic is encapsulated to its own file. Clean coders will tell you this is keeping a good Separation of Concerns in your project.

### Bonus Exercises:

* Remember how I mentioned that Phaser 3 has a great plugin system? Here's an example of how to register a custom game object with Phaser: https://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src/plugins/custom%20game%20object.js. Transform our `TextButton` into an plugin.
* The concept of a button isn't special to Phaser! Try doing the same thing with a `<div>` html element and listening for `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `mousedown`, `mouseup` events and changing something about the `<div>` for each of them.
* What if you want your `TextButton` to have different colors for each of its states? Enhance the `TextButton` to allow the user to change the styles for each state. Hint: pass in more parameters via the constructor, or add some setter methods!
* Add a new "clicked" state to the button (much like the `visited` state of a link on a website).
* Make an `ImageButton` that shows a different image for each of the button's states.
