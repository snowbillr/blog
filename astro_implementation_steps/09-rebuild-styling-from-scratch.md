### 2. Rebuild Styling from Scratch

*   **Action:** Do not migrate any old CSS files. Instead, customize the default styles provided by the Astro blog template.
*   **Location:** All new CSS will be located in `astro_blog/src/styles/`.
*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Start with `astro_blog/src/styles/global.css` for site-wide styles.
    2.  Create new CSS files for specific components as needed and import them directly into your Astro components.
